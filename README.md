# MultisensorSCL
This repository provides the official implementation of MultisensorSCL. The code structure is heavily inspired by Tensorflow. MultisensorSCL performs supervised contrastive learning (SCL) with time-series data augmentation. Tasks involve transfer learning and fine turing with SCL-based pretrainined encoder on multiesnsor signal data.
